# Tableau-Certificate
A Capstone Project in completion of the UC Davis certificate in Coursera for Tableau
Introduction
I completed the Coursera Tableau Visualizations Class. For my project, I used a real-world dataset on space walks outside the International Space Station (ISS). In this project, my focus was on adding data and minimizing visual clutter.

Dataset Description
The dataset I used contained information on every space walk performed outside the ISS since 1998. It included details such as the date, duration, crew members involved, the country of the crew members, and the purpose of each space walk.

Data Analysis and Visualizations
I created interactive visualizations using Tableau that focused on adding data and minimizing visual clutter.

The first visualization was an interactive table that allowed users to view space walks by year. Users could filter by year, and the table would update to show only the space walks that occurred in that year. This visualization made it easy to compare the number of space walks in different years and see trends over time.

The second visualization was a packed bubble chart that showed space walks by country and walk duration. Each bubble represented a country, and the size of the bubble represented the total duration of all the space walks performed by crew members from that country. The color of the bubble represented the country, making it easy to identify each country's space walks. The chart's interactive feature allowed users to zoom in and out and see more detailed information about each country.

The third visualization was a tree map that also showed space walks by country and walk duration. Each rectangle represented a country, and the size of the rectangle represented the total duration of all the space walks performed by crew members from that country. The color of the rectangle represented the country, making it easy to identify each country's space walks. This visualization made it easy to compare the duration of space walks between countries and see which countries had the most extended space walks.

Insights and Conclusion
Overall, the project allowed me to gain insights into the history of space walks and the work performed outside the ISS. By creating visualizations that focused on adding data and minimizing visual clutter, I was able to communicate insights more effectively. The interactive tables, packed bubble chart, and tree map made it easy to explore the data and find patterns.

In conclusion, the Coursera Tableau Visualizations Class was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge of data visualization to a real-world dataset. I enjoyed working on this project and am excited to continue using Tableau in future data-driven projects.
